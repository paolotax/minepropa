I have three meals a day.

In the morning, I have a quick breakfast because I'm always in a hurry: I eat some cookies or a piece of cake and I drink orange juice or milk.

When I come back home, I have lunch. If there is my mother, she cooks for us pasta with vegetables and we always eat on the sofa, watching television. If she is at work she usually leave me some food that I can cook in the microwave hoven. Sometimes I try to cook pasta and it's quite good. 

In the evening I have dinner with all my family. My mother is a crative cook and she always prepares good food for us. Vegetables soups, rice, meat, salads, are all good and healthy, but my favourite dishes are the traditional ones: tortellini, lasagne and cotechino with pur√®. 

I hate the taste of basilico
