I have three meals a day.

In the morning, I have a quick breakfast because I'm always in a hurry: I eat some cookies or a piece of cake and I drink orange juice or milk.

When I come back home, I have lunch. If there is my mother, she cooks for us pasta with vegetables and we always eat on the sofa, watching television. If she is at work she usually leave me some food that I can cook in the microwave hoven. Sometimes I try to cook pasta and it's quite good. 

In the evening I have dinner with all my family. My mother is a crative cook and she always prepares good food for us. Vegetables soups, rice, meat, salads, are all good and healthy, but my favourite dishes are the traditional ones: tortellini, lasagne and cotechino with pur√®. 

I hate the taste of basil so I don't like pasta with "pesto alla genovese" which is the favourite food of my little brother.

On sunday my mother cooks her famous chicken with fried potatoes for lunch. It's one of the best I've ever eat and we always fight for the last piece with my brother and my father.

Sometimes on saturday evening, we buy the 'boat of sushi' from the Japanese restaurant near home. I like sushi very much.

On my birthday, I were In Germany with my family, and we went in an amazing hotel where we had a special dinner. I ate salmon with olive sauce and krauti, it had a strange taste but I liked it. My mother ordered a strange dish that the waiter prepared near our table and he suddenly burned it with high flame.
